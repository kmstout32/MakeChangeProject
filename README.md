# Lessons learned 

I learned the following on this project: For loops,how to equate the amount of money left (If the customers money was insufficient), I kept recieving a negative on that part in particular. But the easy fix of multiplying by -1 fixed the issue. My confidence went up while doing this project becuse I realized I retained more knowledge than I had originally thought. I was unable to figure out how to do the change back in the exact dollars and cents overall I am proud of myself.
